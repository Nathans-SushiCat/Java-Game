### What is Java-Game?
I created this small game while I had COVID-19,
which is likely why I came to the stupid idea of using bare Java.

There is no actual gameplay its only a concept game for me.

### Features:
- Cat
- Enemys
- Weapons
- NPC
- Boss??
- PortalGun


## Building the project:
To build Java-Game you need to have Java-JDK installed.
